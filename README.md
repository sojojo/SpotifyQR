SpotifyQR Project

Spotify QR code creation and consumption
This is the normal order of questions that I've gotten so far. Read me! ;p

Wat? 
=========
Spotify is a streaming music service that offers a very comprehensive discography that is available to its users. Spotify has grown in popularity over the past several years, in part because it works exceedingly well on social networks for sharing music legally.

SpotifyQR allows people to produce and consume real world links to Spotify tracks and playlists. (The following principals do work equally well with SoundCloud, youtube, etc. - just substitute those URLs during creation - it will not affect the end users' experience. Unless they are particularly technically illiterate, I suppose.)

The SpotifyQR Project is a result of adhocism ( http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/adhocism ) : it doesn't require any new buggy software to work beyond what is already easily available, and is fully functional despite the alarming lack of engineering. there are just a few extra steps, as a compromise.

That said, it does require 
  a "smart phone" that has a camera (e.g. iPhone, Android, and (Windows I'd assume)) 
  installed Spotify mobile app 
  installed QR code reader 

Why...
=========
Spotify cannot be shared in the physical world using its current internal tools, how they are intended to be used
While, as I've mentioned before, Spotify is exceptionally social-network conscious, you may only share songs/playlists : promote songs
That is because the tools baked into Spotify share by 'pushing' instead of 'pulling'
  There is nothing wrong with that, however it does severely limit sharing potential -> virality.
  There are links that may be shared publicly (via FB, twitter, etc), but you still are limited to people you know.
    That's not especially helpful if you're a musician trying to make it. 
    Discovering local music is still pretty difficult as well - it largely depends on your personal network for discovery.

Who?
=========
Underground artists, independent artists, Co-workers, friends, owners of social venues, etc, etc. 
(feel free to suggest other instences, there are undoubtedly better examples out there)

How?!?
=========
Step by step instructions:

  * Using SpotifyQR:
    0. Download Spotify, QR Reader mobile software
    1. Open  your preferred your preferred QR reader
    2. Scan the QR code using the software
    3. Android: 'Open in Browser' -> should open 
       iPhone, windows: ???  someone test these, por favor :)
    
  * Producing SpotifyQR Codes:
    0. Requirements: Computer w/ internet browsing capability, printer (preferably color), Spotify account (mobile/paid not necessary to produce)
    1. Find a track or playlist to share. Right click (or whatever Apple makes you do), and 'Copy HTTP Link'
      e.g. http://open.spotify.com/track/6ORqU0bHbVCRjXm9AjyHyZ  ->  opens Green Day - 'Time of your Life'
    2. Use an online QR Code generator. They're numerous and usually free. 
      I used this one effectively: http://www.qrstuff.com/
    3. Print out as many QR codes as your heart desires.
      Windows: Microsoft Picture Manager (free I think) > print - select  number of copies on the right, number of copies total, and DE-SELECT 'fit picture to frame' - it tends to crop out important bits (ooh a pun!)
    4. Optional, but suggested - print some album art and maybe 'Using SpotifyQR' step by step here.

Help!!
=========
SpotifyQR 100% open source. 
Support is up to the generosity of others. Don't presume that you're important. Especially if you don't contribute. This is Open Source and is treated in that way. 
Want to make this more user friendly?? Donate a few engineering hours :)
If you can't/won't . That's cool. Send me a friendly note instead. Tell me how you used it
or give me your little sister's phone number ;))
